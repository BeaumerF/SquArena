<p align="center">(Mockup I made before starting the dev)</p>

## How to play?
Each turn, a player will have two random numbers.
Then, he can touch a square, a random value between the 2 numbers will appears.
If it's next to a square of the other player and if the value is bigger, it will catch it.
Let's take as many squares as possible !
